# 2D-Platformer-Game-on-Python
This is a project I started to learn more about the PyGame library and to attempt to make my own small-scale platforming game using this library.

# How It Works: 
The game isn't functional as in terms of playing for some objective but was designed to see if I could program the logic, animation effects and user control required to be able to play
a platformer game. It helped me learn how to manipulate a player on the screem, how to update the screen and how to use design code and classes for objects required in a project.
