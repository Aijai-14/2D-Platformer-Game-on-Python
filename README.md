# 2D-Platformer-Game-on-Python
This is a project I started to learn more about the PyGame library and to attempt to make my own small-scale platforming game using this library.

# How It Works: 
The game will involve at least 5 levels where the user controls a character across a level and reaches the end goal of the level. Possible future edits may 
include ability to attack enemies, collect coins and have boss fights.
